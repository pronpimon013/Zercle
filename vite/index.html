    <h1>Exercise 1: Development Server</h1>

    <h3>A. What is the role of the index.html file?</h3>
    <p>It is the default file of a website. It is the first page that the web browser loads when accessing a folder or a website domain.</p>

    <h3>B. What is the URL you used to view the page? Is it HTTP or HTTPS?</h3>
    <p> It uses HTTP. The URL is:
      http://localhost:63342/vite/index.html?_ijt=alaoorr8l24kou72s6pmre5sh3&_ij_reload=RELOAD_ON_SAVE</p>

    <h3>C. What HTTP status code do you see for index.html? What does it mean?</h3>
    <p>The status code is 200 OK, which means the page was successfully loaded.</p>

    <h3>D. How can you tell the page is being served locally vs from a real domain?</h3>
    <p>You can tell it's being served locally by looking at the URL. If it includes localhost, 127.0.0.1, or starts with file:///, it means the page is running from your local machine.</p>

    <h3>E. What tools did you use to inspect the response?</h3>
    <p>Right-click on the page and select “Inspect”, then go to the “Network” tab to view the status code and response details.</p>
